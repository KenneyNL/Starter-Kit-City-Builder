intro_text = "A neighborhood is calculating energy usage from gaming consoles and TVs.
At House A, they ran 2 gaming consoles and 3 TVs and used a total of 660 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity.
At House B, they ran 4 gaming consoles and 1 TV and used 760 kWh of electricity."

feedback_text = "Correct! You've accurately calculated that gaming consoles use 150 kWh and TVs use 70 kWh. Using a system of equations: 2x + 3y = 660 and 4x + y = 760, you can solve by substitution to find x = 150 and y = 70."
incorrect_feedback = "Not quite right. Try setting up a system of equations:
- House A: 2 gaming consoles + 3 TVs = 660 kWh
- House B: 4 gaming consoles + 1 TV = 760 kWh
Let x be the kWh for gaming consoles and y be the kWh for TVs.
So we have: 2x + 3y = 660 and 4x + y = 760
Solve for y in the second equation: y = 760 - 4x
Substitute into the first equation: 2x + 3(760 - 4x) = 660
Simplify: 2x + 2280 - 12x = 660
Solve: -10x = -1620
Therefore: x = 150 and y = 70"
