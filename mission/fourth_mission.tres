incorrect_feedback = "Not quite right. Remember to follow these steps:
1. Calculate power needed: 2×√40 + 40^0.8
2. For √40, use 6.32 (or calculate precisely)
3. For 40^0.8, use about 19.14
4. Add both parts: 12.64 + 19.14 = 31.78 kilowatts
5. Divide by plant output (40 kW) and round up to a whole number"
