• 2 workers build 6 houses per week
• 4 workers build 12 houses per week
• 6 workers build 18 houses per week
• 10 workers build 30 houses per week

[b][color=#e06666]Company B: Urban Growth Solutions[/color][/b]
• 3 workers build 9 houses per week
• 6 workers build 18 houses per week
• 9 workers build 27 houses per week
• 12 workers build 36 houses per week

If you need 40 houses in a week, which company would require fewer workers?
Enter A or B below.

Hint: Find the pattern for each company, then calculate how many workers would be needed for 40 houses."
